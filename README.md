## EduBlocks Class Project

# Introduction
Hi! If you're reading this, you probally are doing EduBlocks for Coach Austin's to make a web app.
You also probally don't know what the hell html even is or css, but that's okay. That's why I am is here to
briefly explain what each block does and how to use it. üëç

I'll also add links to tools you might need at the very bottom.
