## EduBlocks Class Project

### Introduction
Hi! If you're reading this, you probally are doing EduBlocks for Coach Austin's to make a web app.
You also probally don't know what the hell html even is or css, but that's okay. That's why I'm here to
briefly explain what each block does and how to use it. üëç

I'll also add links to tools you might need at the very bottom.
